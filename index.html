        Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese 
        words ori (“folding”) and kami (“paper”). 
        Traditional origami consists of folding a 
        single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture 
        without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.
